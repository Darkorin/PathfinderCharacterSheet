Most animal companions increase in size when their druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion.

This bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed.</p><p>The first type of bond allows the paladin to enhance her weapon as a standard action by calling upon the aid of a celestial spirit for 1 minute per paladin level. When called, the spirit causes the weapon to shed light as a torch. At 5th level, this spirit grants the weapon a +1 enhancement bonus. For every three levels beyond 5th, the weapon gains another +1 enhancement bonus, to a maximum of +6 at 20th level. These bonuses can be added to the weapon, stacking with existing weapon bonuses to a maximum of +5, or they can be used to add any of the following weapon properties: <i>axiomatic</i>, <i>brilliant energy, defending, disruption, flaming, flaming burst, holy, keen, merciful</i>, and <i>speed</i>. Adding these properties consumes an amount of bonus equal to the property's cost (see Table: Melee Weapon Special Abilities). These bonuses are added to any properties the weapon already has, but duplicate abilities do not stack. If the weapon is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other properties can be added. The bonus and properties granted by the spirit are determined when the spirit is called and cannot be changed until the spirit is called again. The celestial spirit imparts no bonuses if the weapon is held by anyone other than the paladin but resumes giving bonuses if returned to the paladin. These bonuses apply to only one end of a double weapon. A paladin can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 5th, to a total of four times per day at 17th level.</p><p>If a weapon bonded with a celestial spirit is destroyed, the paladin loses the use of this ability for 30 days, or until she gains a level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, the paladin takes a &ndash;1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.</p><p>The second type of bond allows a paladin to gain the service of an unusually intelligent, strong, and loyal steed to serve her in her crusade against evil. This mount is usually a heavy horse (for a Medium paladin) or a pony (for a Small paladin), although more exotic mounts, such as a boar, camel, or dog are also suitable. This mount functions as a druid's animal companion, using the paladin's level as her effective druid level. Bonded mounts have an Intelligence of at least 6. </p><p>Once per day, as a full-round action, a paladin may magically call her mount to her side. This ability is the equivalent of a spell of a level equal to one-third the paladin's level. The mount immediately appears adjacent to the paladin. A paladin can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every 4 levels thereafter, for a total of four times per day at 17th level.</p><p>At 11th level, the mount gains the celestial template and becomes a magical beast for the purposes of determining which spells affect it. At 15th level, a paladin's mount gains spell resistance equal to the paladin's level + 11.</p><p>Should the paladin's mount die, the paladin may not summon another mount for 30 days or until she gains a paladin level, whichever comes first.

This bond can take one of two forms: a familiar or a bonded object. A familiar is a magical pet that enhances the wizard's skills and senses and can aid him in magic, while a bonded object is an item a wizard can use to cast additional spells or to serve as a magical item. Once a wizard makes this choice, it is permanent and cannot be changed. Rules for bonded items are given below, while rules for familiars are at the end of this section.</p><p>Wizards who select a bonded object begin play with one at no cost. Objects that are the subject of an arcane bond must fall into one of the following categories: amulet, ring, staff, wand, or weapon. These objects are always masterwork quality. Weapons acquired at 1st level are not made of any special material. If the object is an amulet or ring, it must be worn to have effect, while staves, wands, and weapons must be held in one hand. If a wizard attempts to cast a spell without his bonded object worn or in hand, he must make a concentration check or lose the spell. The DC for this check is equal to 20 + the spell's level. If the object is a ring or amulet, it occupies the ring or neck slot accordingly.</p><p>A bonded object can be used once per day to cast any one spell that the wizard has in his spellbook and is capable of casting, even if the spell is not prepared. This spell is treated like any other spell cast by the wizard, including casting time, duration, and other effects dependent on the wizard's level. This spell cannot be modified by metamagic feats or other abilities. The bonded object cannot be used to cast spells from the wizard's opposition schools (see arcane school).</p><p>A wizard can add additional magic abilities to his bonded object as if he has the required item creation feats and if he meets the level prerequisites of the feat. For example, a wizard with a bonded dagger must be at least 5th level to add magic abilities to the dagger (see the Craft Magic Arms and Armor feat in Feats). If the bonded object is a wand, it loses its wand abilities when its last charge is consumed, but it is not destroyed and it retains all of its bonded object properties and can be used to craft a new wand. The magic properties of a bonded object, including any magic abilities added to the object, only function for the wizard who owns it. If a bonded object's owner dies, or the item is replaced, the object reverts to being an ordinary masterwork item of the appropriate type.</p><p>If a bonded object is damaged, it is restored to full hit points the next time the wizard prepares his spells. If the object of an arcane bond is lost or destroyed, it can be replaced after 1 week in a special ritual that costs 200 gp per wizard level plus the cost of the masterwork item. This ritual takes 8 hours to complete. Items replaced in this way do not possess any of the additional enchantments of the previous bonded item. A wizard can designate an existing magic item as his bonded item. This functions in the same way as replacing a lost or destroyed item except that the new magic item retains its abilities while gaining the benefits and drawbacks of becoming a bonded item.</p>","name":"Arcane Bond","url":"pfsrd://Core Rulebook/Classes/Wizard/Class Features/Arcane Bond","ability_types":{"ability_type":"Spell-Like"},"source":"Core Rulebook","type":"ability"},{"body":"<p id=\"arcane-school\">A wizard can choose to specialize in one school of magic, gaining additional spells and powers based on that school.

A wizard who prepares spells from his opposition schools must use two spell slots of that level to prepare the spell. For example, a wizard with evocation as an opposition school must expend two of his available 3rd-level spell slots to prepare a <i>fireball</i>.

The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a sorcerer's spell is 10 + the spell level + the sorcerer's Charisma modifier.</p><p>Like other spellcasters, a sorcerer can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day.

A sorcerer begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new sorcerer level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table: Sorcerer Spells Known. (Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a sorcerer knows is not affected by her Charisma score; the numbers on Table: Sorcerer Spells Known are fixed.)

In effect, the sorcerer loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell's level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. A sorcerer may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level.</p><p>Unlike a wizard or a cleric, a sorcerer need not prepare her spells in advance.

Since the assistants' spells are cast simply to improve your caster level for the purpose of the <i>binding</i> spell, saving throws and spell resistance against the assistants' spells are irrelevant. Your caster level determines whether the target gets an initial Will saving throw and how long the <i>binding</i> lasts. All <i>binding</i> spells are dismissible.</p><p>Regardless of the version of <i>binding</i> you cast, you can specify triggering conditions that end the spell and release the creature whenever they occur. These triggers can be as simple or elaborate as you desire, but the condition must be reasonable and have a likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions can be based on a creature's name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities.

The duration is 1 year per caster level. The subject of this form of <i>binding</i> is confined to the spot it occupied when it received the spell. Casting this version requires a chain that is long enough to wrap around the creature three times.</p><p><i>Slumber</i>: This version causes the subject to become comatose for as long as 1 year per caster level. The subject does not need to eat or drink while slumbering, nor does it age. This form of <i>binding</i> is slightly easier to resist. Reduce the spell's save DC by 1. Casting this version requires a jar of sand or rose petals. This is a sleep effect.</p><p><i>Bound Slumber</i>: This combination of chaining and slumber lasts for as long as 1 month per caster level. Reduce the save DC by 2. Casting this version requires both a long chain and a jar of sand or rose petals. This is a sleep effect.</p><p><i>Hedged Prison</i>: The subject is transported to or otherwise brought within a confined area from which it cannot wander by any means. This effect is permanent. Reduce the save DC by 3. Casting this version requires a tiny golden cage worth 100 gp that is consumed when the spell is cast.</p><p><i>Metamorphosis</i>: The subject assumes gaseous form, except for its head or face. It is held harmless in a jar or other container, which may be transparent if you so choose. The creature remains aware of its surroundings and can speak, but it cannot leave the container, attack, or use any of its powers or abilities. The <i>binding</i> is permanent. The subject does not need to breathe, eat, or drink while metamorphosed, nor does it age. Reduce the save DC by 4.</p><p><i>Minimus Containment</i>: The subject is shrunk to a height of 1 inch or less and held within some gem, jar, or similar object. The <i>binding</i> is permanent. The subject does not need to breathe, eat, or drink while contained, nor does it age. Reduce the save DC by 4.</p><p>You can't dispel a <i>binding</i> spell with <i>dispel magic</i> or a similar effect, though an <i>antimagic field</i> or <i>mage's disjunction</i> affects it normally.

Had the dispel check been a 16 or less, no spells would have been affected.</p><p>You can also use a targeted dispel to specifically end one spell affecting the target or one spell affecting an area (such as a <i>wall of fire</i>). You must name the specific spell effect to be targeted in this way. If your caster level check is equal to or higher than the DC of that spell, it ends. No other spells or effects on the target are dispelled if your check is not high enough to end the targeted effect.</p><p>If you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by <i>summon monster</i>), you make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature.</p><p>If the object that you target is a magic item, you make a dispel check against the item's caster level (DC = 11 + the item's caster level). If you succeed, all the item's magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers its magical properties. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional opening (such as a <i>bag of holding</i>) is temporarily closed. A magic item's physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed magic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.</p><p>You automatically succeed on your dispel check against any spell that you cast yourself.</p><p><i>Counterspell</i>: When <i>dispel magic</i> is used in this way, the spell targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell. Unlike a true counterspell, however, <i>dispel magic</i> may not work; you must make a dispel check to counter the other spellcaster's spell.</p>","school":"abjuration","saving_throw":"none","description":"Cancels one magical spell or effect.","url":"pfsrd://Core Rulebook/Spells/Dispel Magic","spell_resistance":"no","casting_time":"1 standard action","level_text":"Antipaladin: 3; Arcanist: 3; Bard: 3; Cleric: 3; Druid: 4; Hunter: 4; Hunter: 4; Hunter: 4; Inquisitor: 3; Magus: 3; Oracle: 3; Paladin: 3; Shaman: 3; Skald: 3; Sorcerer: 3; Summoner: 3; Warpriest: 3; Witch: 3; Wizard: 3","source":"Core Rulebook","range":"medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)","levels":[{"class":"Antipaladin","level":3},{"class":"Arcanist","level":3},{"class":"Bard","level":3},{"class":"Cleric","level":3},{"class":"Druid","level":4},{"class":"Hunter","level":4},{"class":"Hunter","level":4},{"class":"Hunter","level":4},{"class":"Inquisitor","level":3},{"class":"Magus","level":3},{"class":"Oracle","level":3},{"class":"Paladin","level":3},{"class":"Shaman","level":3},{"class":"Skald","level":3},{"class":"Sorcerer","level":3},{"class":"Summoner","level":3},{"class":"Warpriest","level":3},{"class":"Witch","level":3},{"class":"Wizard","level":3}],"effects":[{"text":"one spellcaster, creature, or object","name":"Target or Area"}],"components":[{"type":"V"},{"type":"S"}],"duration":"instantaneous","type":"spell","component_text":"V, S","name":"Dispel Magic"},{"body":"<p>This spell makes a melee weapon deadly to undead.

First, it creates an interdimensional connection between your plane of existence and a plane you specify, allowing travel between those two planes in either direction.</p><p>Second, you may then call a particular individual or kind of being through the <i>gate</i>.</p><p>The <i>gate</i> itself is a circular hoop or disk from 5 to 20 feet in diameter (caster's choice) oriented in the direction you desire when it comes into existence (typically vertical and facing you). It is a two-dimensional window looking into the plane you specified when casting the spell, and anyone or anything that moves through is shunted instantly to the other side.</p><p>A <i>gate</i> has a front and a back. Creatures moving through the <i>gate</i> from the front are transported to the other plane; creatures moving through it from the back are not.</p><p><i>Planar Travel</i>: As a mode of planar travel, a <i>gate</i> spell functions much like a <i>plane shift</i> spell, except that the <i>gate</i> opens precisely at the point you desire (a creation effect). Deities and other beings who rule a planar realm can prevent a <i>gate</i> from opening in their presence or personal demesnes if they so desire. Travelers need not join hands with you&mdash;anyone who chooses to step through the portal is transported. A <i>gate</i> cannot be opened to another point on the same plane; the spell works only for interplanar travel.</p><p>You may hold the <i>gate</i> open only for a brief time (no more than 1 round per caster level), and you must concentrate on doing so, or else the interplanar connection is severed.</p><p><i>Calling Creatures</i>: The second effect of the <i>gate</i> spell is to call an extraplanar creature to your aid (a calling effect). By naming a particular being or kind of being as you cast the spell, you cause the <i>gate</i> to open in the immediate vicinity of the desired creature and pull the subject through, willing or unwilling. Deities and unique beings are under no compulsion to come through the <i>gate</i>, although they may choose to do so of their own accord. This use of the spell creates a <i>gate</i> that remains open just long enough to transport the called creatures. This use of the spell has a material cost of 10,000 gp in rare incense and offerings. This cost is in addition to any cost that must be paid to the called creatures.</p><p>If you choose to call a kind of creature instead of a known individual, you may call either a single creature or several creatures. In either case, their total HD cannot exceed twice your caster level. In the case of a single creature, you can control it if its HD does not exceed your caster level. A creature with more HD than your caster level can't be controlled. Deities and unique beings cannot be controlled in any event. An uncontrolled being acts as it pleases, making the calling of such creatures rather dangerous. An uncontrolled being may return to its home plane at any time.</p><p>If you choose to exact a longer or more involved form of service from a called creature, you must offer some fair trade in return for that service. The service exacted must be reasonable with respect to the promised favor or reward; see the <i>lesser planar ally</i> spell for appropriate rewards. Some creatures may want their payment in &ldquo;livestock&rdquo; rather than in coin, which could involve complications. Immediately upon completion of the service, the being is transported to your vicinity, and you must then and there turn over the promised reward. After this is done, the creature is instantly freed to return to its own plane.</p><p>Failure to fulfill the promise to the letter results in your being subjected to service by the creature or by its liege and master, at the very least. At worst, the creature or its kin may attack you.</p><p><i>Note</i>: When you use a calling spell such as <i>gate</i> to call an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it becomes a spell of that type.</p>","school":"conjuration","saving_throw":"none","description":"Connects two planes for travel or summoning.","url":"pfsrd://Core Rulebook/Spells/Gate","spell_resistance":"no","casting_time":"1 standard action","level_text":"Arcanist: 9; Cleric: 9; Elementalist Wizard: 9; Oracle: 9; Sorcerer: 9; Warpriest: 9; Wizard: 9","source":"Core Rulebook","range":"medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)","levels":[{"class":"Arcanist","level":9},{"class":"Cleric","level":9},{"class":"Elementalist Wizard","level":9},{"class":"Oracle","level":9},{"class":"Sorcerer","level":9},{"class":"Warpriest","level":9},{"class":"Wizard","level":9}],"effects":[{"text":"see text","name":"Effect"}],"components":[{"type":"V"},{"type":"S"},{"text":"see text","type":"M"}],"duration":"instantaneous or concentration (up to 1 round/level); see text","subschool_text":"creation or calling","subschool":["creation","calling"],"type":"spell","component_text":"V, S, M (see text)","name":"Gate"},{"as_spell_id":248,"level_text":"Arcanist: 6; Bard: 6; Cleric: 6; Inquisitor: 5; Oracle: 6; Skald: 6; Sorcerer: 6; Warpriest: 6; Witch: 6; Wizard: 6","duration":"1 day/level or until discharged (D)","source":"Core Rulebook","component_text":"V","subschool_text":"compulsion","subschool":["compulsion"],"type":"spell","body":"<p>This spell functions similarly to <i>lesser geas</i>, except that it affects a creature of any HD and allows no saving throw.</p><p>If the subject is prevented from obeying the <i>geas/quest</i> for 24 hours, it takes a &ndash;3 penalty to each of its ability scores.

Typically, any creature entering the warded area or opening the warded object without speaking a password (which you set when casting the spell) is subject to the magic it stores. Alternatively or in addition to a password trigger, glyphs can be set according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight) or creature type, subtype, or kind. Glyphs can also be set with respect to good, evil, law, or chaos, or to pass those of your religion. They cannot be set according to class, HD, or level. Glyphs respond to invisible creatures normally but are not triggered by those who travel past them ethereally. Multiple glyphs cannot be cast on the same area. However, if a cabinet has three different drawers, each can be separately warded.</p><p>When casting the spell, you weave a tracery of faintly glowing lines around the warding sigil. A glyph can be placed to conform to any shape up to the limitations of your total square footage. When the spell is completed, the glyph and tracery become nearly invisible.</p><p>Glyphs cannot be affected or bypassed by such means as physical or magical probing, though they can be dispelled. <i>Mislead</i>, <i>polymorph</i>, and <i>nondetection </i>(and similar magical effects) can fool a glyph, though nonmagical disguises and the like can't. <i>Read magic </i>allows you to identify a <i>glyph of warding </i>with a DC 13 Knowledge (arcana) check.

All level-dependent features of the spell are based on your caster level at the time of casting the glyph<i>. </i>If the spell has a target, it targets the intruder. If the spell has an area or an amorphous effect, the area or effect is centered on the intruder. If the spell summons creatures, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack.

Creatures in the area, or who later enter the area, receive only one attempt to suppress effects that are controlling them. If successful, such effects are suppressed as long as they remain in the area. Creatures that leave the area and come back are not protected. You must overcome a creature's spell resistance in order to keep it at bay (as in the third function of <i>protection from evil</i>), but the deflection and resistance bonuses and the protection from mental control apply regardless of enemies' spell resistance.</p><p>This spell has an alternative version that you may choose when casting it. A <i>magic circle against evil</i> can be focused inward rather than outward. When focused inward, the spell binds a nongood called creature (such as those called by the <i>lesser planar binding, planar binding</i>, and <i>greater planar binding</i> spells) for a maximum of 24 hours per caster level, provided that you cast the spell that calls the creature within 1 round of casting the <i>magic circle</i>. The creature cannot cross the circle's boundaries. If a creature too large to fit into the spell's area is the subject of the spell, the spell acts as a normal <i>protection from evil</i> spell for that creature only.</p><p>A <i>magic circle</i> leaves much to be desired as a trap. If the circle of powdered silver laid down in the process of spellcasting is broken, the effect immediately ends. The trapped creature can do nothing that disturbs the circle, directly or indirectly, but other creatures can. If the called creature has spell resistance, it can test the trap once a day. If you fail to overcome its spell resistance, the creature breaks free, destroying the circle. A creature capable of any form of dimensional travel (<i>astral projection, blink, dimension door, etherealness, gate, plane shift, shadow walk, teleport</i>, and similar abilities) can simply leave the circle through such means. You can prevent the creature's extradimensional escape by casting a <i>dimensional anchor</i> spell on it, but you must cast the spell before the creature acts. If you are successful, the <i>anchor</i> effect lasts as long as the <i>magic circle</i> does. The creature cannot reach across the <i>magic circle</i>, but its ranged attacks (ranged weapons, spells, magical abilities, and the like) can. The creature can attack any target it can reach with its ranged attacks except for the circle itself.</p><p>You can add a special diagram (a two-dimensional bounded figure with no gaps along its circumference, augmented with various magical sigils) to make the <i>magic circle</i> more secure. Drawing the diagram by hand takes 10 minutes and requires a DC 20 Spellcraft check. You do not know the result of this check. If the check fails, the diagram is ineffective. You can take 10 when drawing the diagram if you are under no particular time pressure to complete the task. This task also takes 10 full minutes. If time is no factor at all, and you devote 3 hours and 20 minutes to the task, you can take 20.</p><p>A successful diagram allows you to cast a <i>dimensional anchor</i> spell on the <i>magic circle</i> during the round before casting any summoning spell. The <i>anchor</i> holds any called creatures in the <i>magic circle</i> for 24 hours per caster level. A creature cannot use its spell resistance against a <i>magic circle</i> prepared with a diagram, and none of its abilities or attacks can cross the diagram. If the creature tries a Charisma check to break free of the trap (see the <i>lesser planar binding</i> spell), the DC increases by 5. The creature is immediately released if anything disturbs the diagram&mdash;even a straw laid across it. The creature itself cannot disturb the diagram either directly or indirectly, as noted above.</p><p>This spell is not cumulative with <i>protection from evil</i> and vice versa.</p>","school":"abjuration","saving_throw":"Will negates (harmless)","description":"As protection spells, but 10-ft. radius and 10 min./level.","source":"Core Rulebook","url":"pfsrd://Core Rulebook/Spells/Magic Circle Against Evil","spell_resistance":"no; see text","casting_time":"1 standard action","level_text":"Arcanist: 3; Cleric: 3; Inquisitor: 3; Oracle: 3; Paladin: 3; Shaman: 3; Sorcerer: 3; Summoner: 3; Warpriest: 3; Wizard: 3","descriptor":["good"],"range":"touch","levels":[{"class":"Arcanist","level":3},{"class":"Cleric","level":3},{"class":"Inquisitor","level":3},{"class":"Oracle","level":3},{"class":"Paladin","level":3},{"class":"Shaman","level":3},{"class":"Sorcerer","level":3},{"class":"Summoner","level":3},{"class":"Warpriest","level":3},{"class":"Wizard","level":3}],"descriptor_text":"good","effects":[{"text":"10-ft.-radius emanation from touched creature","name":"Area"}],"components":[{"type":"V"},{"type":"S"},{"text":"a 3-ft.-diameter circle of powdered silver","type":"M"},{"text":"a 3-ft.-diameter circle of powdered silver","type":"DF"}],"duration":"10 min./level","type":"spell","component_text":"V, S, M/DF (a 3-ft.-diameter circle of powdered silver)","name":"Magic Circle Against Evil"},{"body":"<p>This spell functions like <i>magic circle against evil</i>, except that it is similar to <i>protection from good</i> instead of <i>protection from evil</i>, and it can imprison a nonevil called creature.</p>","school":"abjuration","description":"As protection spells, but 10-ft. radius and 10 min./level.","source":"Core Rulebook","url":"pfsrd://Core Rulebook/Spells/Magic Circle Against Good","level_text":"Antipaladin: 3; Arcanist: 3; Cleric: 3; Inquisitor: 3; Oracle: 3; Shaman: 3; Sorcerer: 3; Summoner: 3; Warpriest: 3; Wizard: 3","descriptor":["evil"],"levels":[{"class":"Antipaladin","level":3},{"class":"Arcanist","level":3},{"class":"Cleric","level":3},{"class":"Inquisitor","level":3},{"class":"Oracle","level":3},{"class":"Shaman","level":3},{"class":"Sorcerer","level":3},{"class":"Summoner","level":3},{"class":"Warpriest","level":3},{"class":"Wizard","level":3}],"descriptor_text":"evil","type":"spell","name":"Magic Circle Against Good"},{"body":"<p>This spell functions like <i>magic fang</i>, except that the enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls is +1 per four caster levels (maximum +5).

The kind of creature to be bound must be known and stated. If you wish to call a specific individual, you must use that individual's proper name in casting the spell.</p><p>The target creature is allowed a Will saving throw. If the saving throw succeeds, the creature resists the spell. If the saving throw fails, the creature is immediately drawn to the trap (spell resistance does not keep it from being called). The creature can escape from the trap by successfully pitting its spell resistance against your caster level check, by dimensional travel, or with a successful Charisma check (DC 15 + 1/2 your caster level + your Charisma modifier). It can try each method once per day. If it breaks loose, it can flee or attack you. A <i>dimensional anchor</i> cast on the creature prevents its escape via dimensional travel. You can also employ a calling diagram (see <i>magic circle against evil</i>) to make the trap more secure.</p><p>If the creature does not break free of the trap, you can keep it bound for as long as you dare. You can attempt to compel the creature to perform a service by describing the service and perhaps offering some sort of reward. You make a Charisma check opposed by the creature's Charisma check. The check is assigned a bonus of +0 to +6 based on the nature of the service and the reward. If the creature wins the opposed check, it refuses service. New offers, bribes, and the like can be made or the old ones reoffered every 24 hours. This process can be repeated until the creature promises to serve, until it breaks free, or until you decide to get rid of it by means of some other spell. Impossible demands or unreasonable commands are never agreed to. If you ever roll a natural 1 on the Charisma check, the creature breaks free of the spell's effect and can escape or attack you.</p><p>Once the requested service is completed, the creature need only to inform you to be instantly sent back whence it came.

It strikes the opponent you designate, starting with one attack in the round the spell is cast and continuing each round thereafter on your turn.

It strikes as a spell, not as a weapon, so for example, it can damage creatures that have damage reduction. As a force effect, it can strike incorporeal creatures without the reduction in damage associated with incorporeality. The weapon always strikes from your direction. It does not get a flanking bonus or help a combatant get one. Your feats or combat actions do not affect the weapon. If the weapon goes beyond the spell range, if it goes out of your sight, or if you are not directing it, the weapon returns to you and hovers.</p><p>Each round after the first, you can use a move action to redirect the weapon to a new target. If you do not, the weapon continues to attack the previous round's target. On any round that the weapon switches targets, it gets one attack. Subsequent rounds of attacking that target allow the weapon to make multiple attacks if your base attack bonus would allow it to.

You might even be able to untie simple knots, though delicate activities such as these require DC 15 Intelligence checks.</p><p><i>Combat Maneuver</i>: Alternatively, once per round, you can use <i>telekinesis</i> to perform a bull rush, disarm, grapple (including pin), or trip. Resolve these attempts as normal, except that they don't provoke attacks of opportunity, you use your caster level in place of your Combat Maneuver Bonus, and you add your Intelligence modifier (if a wizard) or Charisma modifier (if a sorcerer) in place of your Strength or Dexterity modifier. No save is allowed against these attempts, but spell resistance applies normally. This version of the spell can last 1 round per caster level, but it ends if you cease concentration.</p><p><i>Violent Thrust</i>: Alternatively, the spell energy can be spent in a single round. You can hurl one object or creature per caster level (maximum 15) that are within range and all within 10 feet of each other toward any target within 10 feet per level of all the objects. You can hurl up to a total weight of 25 pounds per caster level (maximum 375 pounds at 15th level).</p><p>You must succeed on attack rolls (one per creature or object thrown) to hit the target with the items, using your base attack bonus + your Intelligence modifier (if a wizard) or Charisma modifier (if a sorcerer). Weapons cause standard damage (with no Strength bonus; note that arrows or bolts deal damage as daggers of their size when used in this manner). Other objects cause damage ranging from 1 point per 25 pounds (for less dangerous objects) to 1d6 points of damage per 25 pounds (for hard, dense objects). Objects and creatures that miss their target land in a square adjacent to the target.</p><p>Creatures who fall within the weight capacity of the spell can be hurled, but they are allowed Will saves (and spell resistance) to negate the effect, as are those whose held possessions are targeted by the spell.</p><p>If a telekinesed creature is hurled against a solid surface, it takes damage as if it had fallen 10 feet (1d6 points).</p>","school":"transmutation","saving_throw":"Will negates (object) or none; see text","description":"Moves object, attacks creature, or hurls object or creature.","url":"pfsrd://Core Rulebook/Spells/Telekinesis","spell_resistance":"yes (object); see text","casting_time":"1 standard action","level_text":"Arcanist: 5; Magus: 5; Sorcerer: 5; Wizard: 5","source":"Core Rulebook","range":"long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)","levels":[{"class":"Arcanist","level":5},{"class":"Magus","level":5},{"class":"Sorcerer","level":5},{"class":"Wizard","level":5}],"effects":[{"text":"see text","name":"Target or Targets"}],"components":[{"type":"V"},{"type":"S"}],"duration":"concentration (up to 1 round/level) or instantaneous; see text","type":"spell","component_text":"V, S","name":"Telekinesis"},{"body":"<p>This spell functions like <i>resilient sphere</i>, but the creatures or objects caught inside the globe created by the spell are made nearly weightless.

When triggered, a <i>symbol of death </i>kills one or more creatures within 60 feet of the symbol (treat as a burst) whose combined total current hit points do not exceed 150. The <i>symbol of death </i>affects the closest creatures first, skipping creatures with too many hit points to affect. Once triggered, the <i>symbol </i>becomes active and glows, lasting for 10 minutes per caster level or until it has affected 150 hit points' worth of creatures, whichever comes first. A creature that enters the area while the <i>symbol of death </i>is active is subject to its effect, whether or not that creature was in the area when it was triggered. A creature need save against the <i>symbol </i>only once as long as it remains within the area, though if it leaves the area and returns while the <i>symbol </i>is still active, it must save again.</p><p>Until it is triggered, the <i>symbol of death </i>is inactive (though visible and legible at a distance of 60 feet). To be effective, a <i>symbol of death </i>must always be placed in plain sight and in a prominent location. Covering or hiding the rune renders the <i>symbol of death </i>ineffective, unless a creature removes the covering, in which case the <i>symbol of death </i>works normally.</p><p>As a default, a <i>symbol of death </i>is triggered whenever a creature does one or more of the following, as you select: looks at the rune; reads the rune; touches the rune; passes over the rune; or passes through a portal bearing the rune. Regardless of the trigger method or methods chosen, a creature more than 60 feet from a symbol of death can't trigger it (even if it meets one or more of the triggering conditions, such as reading the rune). Once the spell is cast, a <i>symbol of death</i>'s triggering conditions cannot be changed.</p><p>In this case, &ldquo;reading&rdquo; the rune means any attempt to study it, identify it, or fathom its meaning. Throwing a cover over a <i>symbol of death </i>to render it inoperative triggers it if the symbol reacts to touch. You can't use a <i>symbol of death </i>offensively; for instance, a touch-triggered <i>symbol of death</i> remains untriggered if an item bearing the <i>symbol of death </i>is used to touch a creature. Likewise, a <i>symbol of death </i>cannot be placed on a weapon and set to activate when the weapon strikes a foe.</p><p>You can also set special triggering limitations of your own. These can be as simple or elaborate as you desire. Special conditions for triggering a <i>symbol of death </i>can be based on a creature's name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, HD, and hit points don't qualify. </p><p>When scribing a <i>symbol of death</i>, you can specify a password or phrase that prevents a creature using it from triggering the symbol's effect<i>. </i>Anyone using the password remains immune to that particular rune's effects so long as the creature remains within 60 feet of the rune. If the creature leaves the radius and returns later, it must use the password again.</p><p>You also can attune any number of creatures to the <i>symbol of death, </i>but doing this can extend the casting time. Attuning one or two creatures takes negligible time, and attuning a small group (as many as 10 creatures) extends the casting time to 1 hour. Attuning a large group (as many as 25 creatures) takes 24 hours. Attuning larger groups takes an additional 24 hours per 25 creatures. Any creature attuned to a <i>symbol of death </i>cannot trigger it and is immune to its effects, even if within its radius when it is triggered. You are automatically considered attuned to your own <i>symbols of death</i>, and thus always ignore the effects and cannot inadvertently trigger them.</p><p><i>Read magic </i>allows you to identify a <i>symbol </i>with a Spellcraft check (DC 10 + the <i>symbol's </i>spell level). Of course, if the <i>symbol </i>is set to be triggered by reading it, this will trigger the symbol.</p><p>A <i>symbol of death </i>can be removed by a successful <i>dispel magic </i>targeted solely on the rune. An <i>erase </i>spell has no effect on a <i>symbol of death. </i>Destruction of the surface where a <i>symbol of death </i>is inscribed destroys the <i>symbol </i>but also triggers it.</p><p><i>Symbol of death </i>can be made permanent with a <i>permanency </i>spell.
