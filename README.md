> Pathfinder is a role playing Dungeons & Dragons tabletop game. Building a Character is an integral part of play. Currently this is typically done manually by paper while constantly referencing the extensive handbook. This character builder will streamline the process digitally.

As participants in this community we have identified  the issue of no satisfactory dynamic character sheets available online. Developing this will allow players to automatically filter down choices based on their selections to streamline the character creation process.
